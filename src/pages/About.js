            <h2>Welcome to Tara's Media Store</h2>
            <p>I created Media Store using the iTunes API to enable users to discover their favourite music, films and TV shows and add them to their Basket.
        
                How to use Media Store:
                1. To search, simply enter the artist name or keyword using the search bar on the homepage.
                2. Add the song or film to your basket by clicking 'Add'. If you change your mind you can remove it by clicking 'Remove'. </p>

            
            </div>       
            //  </div>
    )
